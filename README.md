# UPDATED VERSION OF PAWFINDER

1. Updated UI to be more user-friendly and easy to use.
2. Optimized the website speed by removing useless and redundant code and updating the existing features to be more straight-forward.
3. Added modularity by saperating ML model into a different API which can be accessed through my github repository "Dog-Breed-API".

## Additional Note:
(It hasn't been deployed because to make use of its main feature "Breed Classification" we need to deploy the API too which I couldn't due to some limitations on "Free-Tier" on deployment service providers although I reduced its size by applying some logic myself rather than using heavy libraries but still too big.)
